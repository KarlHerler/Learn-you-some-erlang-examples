You should write these yourself and you should also [learn some erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/)

These are the code examples from the [Learn you some erlang e-book](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/). 
Most are just straight from there with perhaps a tad bit of commentary, some are slightly modified 
from experiments.
